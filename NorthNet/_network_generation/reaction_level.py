def run_reaction(reactant_compounds, reaction_template):
    '''
    Performs a chemical reaction.

    Mapping can be added:
        Set atom map numbers of reactants before performing the reaction.
        Atom mappings can be removed:
        rdkit.Chem.rdChemReactions.RemoveMappingNumbersFromReactions((ChemicalReaction)reaction) â†’ None

    Parameters
    ----------
    reactants: tuple
        tuple of rdkit Mol objects which take part in the reaction.
    reaction_template: list
        A list of NetGen Reaction_Template objects.

    Returns
    -------
    reactions: list
        A list of NetGen Generated_Reaction objects.
