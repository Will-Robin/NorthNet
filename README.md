# NorthNet

A Python package which aims to provide tools in understanding chemical reactions at the network level.

Have a look in the scripts folder for examples of how to use NorthNet (there is a walkthrough in `NetworkGenerationNotebook.ipynb`).

## Core functionality

- Reaction-rule based network generation
- Network manipulation and editing
- Conversion of networks into mathematical models
- Experimental reaction data integration with reaction networks
- *Future* data manipulation guided by reaction networks.

Documentation has been started [here](https://will-robin.github.io/NorthNet/).
